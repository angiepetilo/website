        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am Angie Petilo, a passionate 3rd-year Computer 
            Science student and aspiring Full Stack Developer. 
            Currently honing my skills in both front-end and 
            back-end technologies, I enjoy building responsive, 
            user-friendly applications and exploring how design 
            and functionality come together. My academic projects 
            have given me hands-on experience with modern frameworks, 
            databases, and collaborative development practices, 
            strengthening my problem-solving abilities and adaptability. 
            Driven by curiosity and a love for continuous learning, 
            I actively seek out new tools and frameworks to expand my 
            knowledge and stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech industry. 
            I am eager to apply my growing expertise to real-world projects 
            and contribute to innovative teams while continuing to develop 
            as a versatile developer.
